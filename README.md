## Abstract

Here we release draft genome sequences of Zika virus (ZIKV) that were sequenced from PCR-positive diagnostic specimens collected by the United States Virgin Islands Department of Health (USVI DoH) as part of their ongoing response to the ZIKV outbreak. We will use these sequences to conduct a genomic epidemiological study of ZIKV transmission in the USVI. We are releasing these genomes in the hope that they are useful for those individuals involved in the public health response to ZIKV and to other groups working to understand Zika virus transmission and evolution.

This work represents a pre-publication sharing of pathogen genomic data of public health significance. [We believe that open sharing of sequence data and early analyses is necessary to inform public health response in a timely fashion](http://bedford.io/blog/scientific-publishing-practices/). We intend for this to serve as a "marker paper" specifying analyses planned for these data. Please consider the analysis of Zika in the USVI ([as described in the "Genome Announcement"](announcement/)) as off limits. However, integrating these data as auxiliary data into other sorts of publications is fine. All we ask is for a citation and a heads up. We plan to replace this "announcement" with a preprint and eventually with a publication. The citation will be continually updated throughout this process.

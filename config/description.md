Data collection in the US Virgin Islands was made possible via a collaboration with the US Virgin Islands Department of Health, specifically Dr. Esther Ellis and Dr. Brett Ellis. We thank them for all their support in this effort.

The analyses we can do are always improved by larger, broader datasets. Having this kind of dataset, with sequences from many countries throughout Polynesia and the Americas, is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups from all over the world. We gratefully acknowledge all contributors for making their sequence data public.

We thank Adam Geballe for generously loaning space in his laboratory at the Fred Hutch. We also thank Josh Quick, Nick Loman, and Nate Grubaugh for help and support in developing and implementing data collection protocols.

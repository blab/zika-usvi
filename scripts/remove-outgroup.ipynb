    "## README: Removing french polynesian outgroup from posterior distribution of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly root our phylogenies of Zika in the Americas, we included a french polynesian genome as an outgroup. In the BEAST xml we've mandated that American ZIKV genomes be monophyletic, with this french polynesian isolate as an outgroup. However, since we don't want french polynesia as a deme in our phylogeographic analysis, we need to remove the french polynesian genome from the posterior sample of trees prior to using these trees. This is actually quite simple to do because the the french polynesian genome is always an outgroup. Therefore we just have to crop the french polynesian genome, as well as the branch leading to the American MRCA, from the tree. I'm doing this cropping by regex pattern finding and substiuting the pattern with an empty string. \n",
    "\n",
    "This regex: `\\(172\\:\\[&rate=[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\][0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\,` matches all taxa information for taxa #172 (which maps to the french polynesian genomes in my Nexus file). It is found right at the beginning of each Newick tree string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This regex `\\[&rate=[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\][0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\)\\;` matches to the branch information for the branch that leads from the outgroup MRCA to the American monophyly MRCA. It also needs to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please note that this code is adapted from Baltic, a python package written by Gytis Dudas, for parsing BEAST trees files. Shout out to him."
